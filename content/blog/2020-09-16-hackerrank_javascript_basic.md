Today I decided to take a peek on Hackerrank's JavaScript (Basic) Skills Certification Test and completes it. Now I have [JavaScript (Basic) Certificate](https://www.hackerrank.com/certificates/ec3599b56cdf) too. Looking forward for Intermediate skills test availability.
I am quite excited about the tasks in the test, because I had the opportunity to use JavaScript's built-in data structures.
